• Curated a dataset for forgery detection and expanded its scope by cropping distinct parts from the same image.

• Acquired knowledge about Convolutions and Recurring Neural Network concepts in Deep Learning

• Conducted a literature review of Deep Learning models and experimented with them on the compiled dataset

• Employed F1 Score as an evaluation metric and implemented the most effective model achieving 75\% accuracy.
