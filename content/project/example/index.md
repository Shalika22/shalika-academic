• Surveyed relevant literature work for improving the existing accuracies for indexing of metadata

• Developed an indexing system using Fuzzywuzzy and Spacy NER model

• Experimented with Tesseract OCR and Easy OCR with combination of four different keyframe detection methods

• Extracted data using YouTube-dl and FFmpeg from relevant educational video lectures (NPTEL, MIT OCW) 

• Applied EasyOCR to locate text in videos on the keyframes that are extracted using OpenCV library ffprobe 

• Created an indexing system by extracting relevant meta data and filtering out the rest using defined rules.

• Evaluated the performance of indexing system using levenshtein distance algorithm
