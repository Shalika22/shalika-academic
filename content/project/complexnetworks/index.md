• Created a citation network as there were no pre-evaluated legal document clusters and networks previously
• Clustered the legal documents, to serve as gold standard, based on subject or category it falls under
• Used NLTK library for processing subject names to identify unique subjects from document-subject map
• Worked on the implementation of the Louvain community detection algorithm for clustering the citation network
